Here are preliminary passbands from Claire.  The Vri are stable across the 
bakeout but the B changes.  The Oct2010 B corresponds to period 2 in the 
CfA4 photometry and June 2012 B (after the bakeout which more or less 
returned the B passband to the period conditions) to period 1.  You can use 
either V date since they're basically the same.

Let me know if you have questions.

Cheers,
Malcolm

Hi Armin,

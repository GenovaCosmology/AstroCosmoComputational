This legacy HST_GOODS/ directory used to be called HST/.
It's name has been changed because HST/ now contains
all HST filters, including the newer ones for HSTMCT.
The HST/ filters were prepared by S.Rodney.

Beware that the filter names in HST/ are slightly
different than in here. For example, 
  HST_GOODS/F110W_NIC2.dat -> HST/NICMOS_NIC2_F110W.dat

# -----------------------------------
HST Filters:

Derived from fits files from Adam Reiss and editted into ascii
files by David Cinabro.  Check out throughput.ps to see the
through puts and note that they agree well with documentation
that can be found on the HST site and filtertrans.dat for the
correspondence between HST filter names and the numbers used
in snana.  

	snana requires the throughputs vs wavelengths to be evenly
spaced in wavelength.  filterfix.f is a simple fortran program that
reads the original filter throughputs and evenly spaces the output
by interpolating the original data.

# Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology

This repository contains the material for the Course "Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology" for the Master in Physics at the Physics Department at the University of Genova.

The repository's main branch will be updated at the beginning of every lesson with exercises covering its specific topic. 

There will typically be three increasing difficulty exercises: the first will be covered during the lesson, and the other two are left for the student. It would be good to complete the exercises before the next one is presented, but it's not mandatory. It's, of course, needed to complete them all for the final exam. 

The exercises will be split into different folders, one per lesson.
Students should create their branch and upload the results of the exercises in that folder.

**The use of git for code sharing is mandatory**. 

A few weeks before the end of the lesson cycle (~ mid-May), we will present the list of projects for the exam.
These projects will cover (most of) the topics discussed in the course. 
There will be individual projects and group projects. More detailed information will come.

## Coding suggestions

The official programming language for this course is Python. 
Installing Python with Anaconda and the **intensive** use of environments are recommended.
We also recommend using Jupyter notebooks as tools for results sharing and Visual Studio Code as a development environment.

The use of custom Python modules, extensive documentation, and object-oriented programming will be particularly appreciated.
There is no specific restriction on the use of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.). Please remember that at the exam, you should be prepared to describe the details of your code.

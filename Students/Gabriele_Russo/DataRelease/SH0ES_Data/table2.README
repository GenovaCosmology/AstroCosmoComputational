This is the full data Table 2 given in the SH0ES paper, Riess et al. (2022)
Those interested in refitting the distance ladder are recommend not to use this table but rather
use the previously available fits files that include this data already packaged (y data vector) with respect to the equations (L matrix file)
that relate them.  Further, the errors listed in table 2 do not include the covariance (off-diagonal) which also
should be taken from the fits file (C matrix).  Also note that the errors given are for the complete NIR Wesenheit magnitudes
so they may not be directly appropriate for any reformulation of these magnitudes.
Alternative selections from this data or uses likely will require a new characterization of uncertainties
based on custom artificial stars tests to mimic a new selection or use.

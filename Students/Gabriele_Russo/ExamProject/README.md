The first file to read is H0chi2.ipynb
It generates, as relevant files, lstsq_analytically.dat and lstsq_scipy.dat

The second file to read is H0mcmc.ipynb which takes as data the file generated by run_mcmc.ipynb called final_v2_baseline.h5
This last file can be doawnloaded at the link given in H0mcmc.ipynb (not done for the exam, 12 GB file) or generated with the impostation in run_mcmc.ipynb such that its dimension are around 754 MB (instead of around 16 milions samples, only 1 milion), again the file is not given since it is bigger than git push can accept (if you wish to run run_mcmc.ipynb, be aware that the simulation on my laptop lasted around 2h).

MCMC_utils.py is as the article one + comments.

sratched_ideas.ipynb, as the name suggests, contains discarted ideas (an idea for a plot which can't be completed with the data at dispousal).

Other files contain data and relative partial explanation.

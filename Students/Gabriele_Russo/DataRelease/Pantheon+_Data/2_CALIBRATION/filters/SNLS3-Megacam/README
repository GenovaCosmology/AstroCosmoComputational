Copied effective Megacam filters from $SCRATCH/JGUY/SNLS-simulation-filters/filters-center dir.
Filters were renamed:
effMEGACAM-g.dat  effMEGACAM-g-wpsf.dat  effMEGACAM-i.dat  effMEGACAM-r.dat  effMEGACAM-z.dat .

These filters are for simulation studies or analyses that do not require high precision.

There are two directories here:

./cosmosis_likelihoods
./chains

In ./cosmosis_likelihoods there are the two codes used in cosmosis: 
   ./cosmosis_likelihoods/Pantheon+SH0ES_cosmosis_likelihood.py
   ./cosmosis_likelihoods/Pantheon+_only_cosmosis_likelihood.py
The difference here is whether or not to use SH0ES Cepheids (a constraint on H0 and M) in the cosmology constraint.

In ./chains there are two directories:
   ./Pantheon+Only # does not use SH0ES Cepheids and does not include constraints on H0 or M.
   ./Pantheon+SH0ES # uses SH0ES Cepheids and includes constraints on H0 and M.

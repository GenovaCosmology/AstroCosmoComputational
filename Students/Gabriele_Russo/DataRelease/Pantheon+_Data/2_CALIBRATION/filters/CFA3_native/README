The 4shooter (UBVRI Harris filter passbands for CfA3) are given 
in the *last* column of the file attached: cfa2.passbands.dat
There was no change between the last CfA2 objects (Jha et al. 2006) 
to the first CfA3 objects.
Note that these are ENERGY units, so divide the sensitivity by lambda.

The Keplercam (UBVri) bandpasses are at
http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/CfA3/keplercam.passbands.txt
There is no U response, so we probably have to stick with the U  
response from the file above.

We don't have the Minicam filter responses, so probably we should use  
the Keplercam ones or toss those 5 light curves.
